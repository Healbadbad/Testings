It seems like Norm's questions are too hard for that guy with the taco shirt

Just about any question is too hard for a guy in a taco shirt.

Whereas when I see a guy in a coffee shirt, he typically has all the answers.

I love that they're keeping the tradition of Will's face on the thumbnail

Making an edit to fix for merging

They are right about it being early for VR and cashing in quick is a good plan.
I imagine they will be forgotten in 2 weeks because of all the problems they will need to face to remain relevant have already been solved by larger companies that will be released in less than a year.
The most impressive thing is that they got the rights to make a The Walking Dead game, but it's just not going to exist outside of an arcade.

What a let down. I talked about this with my wife. I would have loved a really well down "and realistic" Walking Dead experience. Something epic. Not a cheezy FPS. What a let down!

Plus the game they showed off didn't look interesting at all.

"Let's show off our super high FOV by making a demo with tight alleyways and corridors!"

I got the feeling that they think that every game studio will make their own hardware, like with guitar hero...
